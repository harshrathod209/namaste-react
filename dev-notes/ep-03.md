# create scripts in package.json

when a script is added, you can use the script by adding 
- npm run <script name>
- npm run is compulsory prefix when running scripts expect start
- start is a keyword reserved by npm


# Transpiling:

- JSX => bundler(parcel) will transpile using babel to React,createElement() - JS Object => HTMLElement (understandable JS which browsers understand.)

# React components
    1. Class based component - (Old way of coding) - Uses JS classes to create component
    2. Functional component - (New way of coding) - Uses JS functions to create component

# Component Composition
    - Definition : Function composition is a functional programming concept where you combine multiple functions together, so the output of one becomes the input of another.

    *** Example ****
    const TitleComponent = () => <h1>Namaste react ðŸš€</h1>

    const HeadingComponent = () => (
        <div id="container">
            <TileComponent/>
            <h2 className="heading">Function composition</h2>
        </div>
    )

# Cross site scripting
- JSX omits cross site scripting attacks
